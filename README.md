# tic-tac-toe
About the Project

This  Tic Tac Toe game is a Java-based graphical application that allows two players to compete in the classic 3x3 grid game. Built using Java's Swing library, the application features an intuitive interface with interactive buttons for each cell in the grid. Players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on the grid, with the program dynamically updating the interface based on their actions. The game incorporates logic to determine the winner by checking for three consecutive symbols in rows, columns, or diagonals. Additionally, it provides a "Play Again" button that resets the grid and game state for a new round.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, especially in GUI development using Swing. It showcases skills such as event handling for button clicks, designing game logic to handle winning conditions, and structuring code for maintainability and readability.
